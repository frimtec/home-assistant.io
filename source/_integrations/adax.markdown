Integrates Adax heater into Home Assistant.

You can configure the heaters to use a local or cloud interface.

The local integrations only works with newer Adax heaters with both Bluetooth and wifi. Home Assistant uses Bluetooth LE to configure the heaters, this means your machine running “Home Assistant” needs to have a Bluetooth adapter and the heater needs to be in range during setup. For the local integration, you have to reset the heater by pressing + and OK until the display shows 'Reset'. Then press and hold the OK button on the heater until the blue LED starts blinking before pressing Submit. Configuring the heater might take some minutes. Using the local integration will disable cloud communication and the Adax app will not work.

For the cloud integration, you'll need the Account ID (which can be found in the Adax Wifi app, pressing 'Account'. Which you will find as a number between the "log out" and "close account" buttons). 

You will also need a credential, which you can create in the Adax app:

1. Navigate to the Account tab.
2. Go to **Third party integrations**.
3. Select **Remote API**.
4. Select **Add Credential**.
5. Give some name to the created credential (e.g. 'Home Assistant') and copy the generated password.

In the configuration popup you will need the Account ID, and the generated API password (not the account password)
