The to-do list integration provides to-do list entities, allowing other integrations
to integrate to-do lists into Home Assistant. To-do lists are shown on the to-do list
dashboard for tracking items and whether or not they have been completed.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

## Viewing and managing to-do lists

Each to-do list is represented as its own entity in Home Assistant and can be
viewed and managed on a to-do list dashboard. You can find the to-do list dashboard
in the main sidebar of your Home Assistant instance.

## The state of a to-do list entity

The state of a to-do list entity is a number, which represents the number of
incomplete items in the list.


## Services

Some to-do list integrations allow Home Assistant to manage the to-do items in the list. The
services provided by some to-do list entities are described below or you can read more about [Service Calls](/docs/scripts/service-calls/).

### Service `todo.add_item`

Add a new to-do item. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector) and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `item` | no | the name of the to-do Item. | Submit income tax return

This is a full example of service call in YAML:

```yaml
service: todo.add_item
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
data:
  item: "Submit income tax return"
```

### Service `todo.update_item`

Update a to-do item. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector) and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `item` | no | The name of the to-do item to update. | Submit income tax return
| `rename` | yes | The new name of the to-do item. | Something else
| `status` | yes | The overall status of the to-do item. |  `needs_action` or `completed`

At least one of `rename` or `status` is required. This is a full example of
a service call that updates the status and the name of a to-do item.

```yaml
service: todo.update_item
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
data:
  item: "Submit income tax return"
  rename: "Something else"
  status: "completed"
```

### Service `todo.remove_item`

Removing a to-do item. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector), and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `item` | no | The name of the to-do item. | Submit income tax return

This is a full example of a service call that deletes a to-do Item with the specified name.

```yaml
service: todo.remove_item
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
data:
  item: "Submit income tax return"
```
