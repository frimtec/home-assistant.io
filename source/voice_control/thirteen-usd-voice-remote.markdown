"></lite-youtube>

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2023.10, installed with the Home Assistant Operating System
- [Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.nabucasa.com) or a manually configured [Assist Pipeline](/voice_control/voice_remote_local_assistant)
- The password to your 2.4&nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi network
- Chrome (or a Chromium-based browser like Edge) on desktop (not Android/iOS)
- [M5Stack ATOM Echo Development Kit](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-echo-smart-speaker-dev-kit?ref=NabuCasa)
- USB-C cable to connect the ATOM Echo

## Adding a wake word to your voice assistant

1. Install the openWakeWord add-on:
   - Follow steps 1-3 of the procedure on [enabling a wake word](/voice_control/install_wake_word_add_on). 
2. Go to {% my voice_assistants title="**Settings** > **Voice assistants**" %} and select **Add assistant**.
3. Give your assistant a name, for example the wake word you are going to use.
4. Select the language you are going to use to speak to Home Assistant.
   - If the **Text-to-speech** and **Speech-to-text** sections do not provide language selectors, this means you do not have an Assist pipeline set up.
   - Set up [Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.nabucasa.com) or a manually configured [Assist pipeline](/voice_control/voice_remote_local_assistant).
5. Under **Text-to-speech**, select the language and voice you want Home Assistant to use when speaking to you.
6. To define the wake word engine, under **Wake word**, select **openWakeWord**.
   - Then, select **ok nabu**.
   - If you created a new assistant, select **Create**.
   - If you edited an existing assistant, select **Update**.
   - **Result**: You now have a voice assistant that listens to a wake word.
7. For the first run, it is recommended to use **ok nabu**, just to test the setup.
   - Once you have it all set up, you can [create your own wake words](/voice_control/create_wake_word/).

## Installing the software onto the ATOM Echo

If you have used the ATOM Echo on Home Assistant before and have it installed via ESPHome add-on, you first need to remove its configuration.

### To delete the ATOM Echo configuration from ESPHome

1. Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %}, and select the ESPHome integration.
   - Under **Devices**, next to the **M5Stack Atom Echo a61920** entry, select the three-dots menu.
   - Select **Delete**.
2. Make sure you have [access to the configuration files](/common-tasks/os/#configuring-access-to-files).
   - If you have never done this before, [install the file editor add-on](/common-tasks/os/#installing-and-using-the-file-editor-add-on).
3. Access the config files and open the **esphome** folder.
4. If there is a configuration file for the ATOM Echo, delete it.

### To install the software on your ATOM Echo

Before you can use this device with Home Assistant, you need to install a bit of software on it.

1. Make sure this page is opened in a Chromium-based browser on a desktop. It does not work on a tablet or phone.
   - Select the **Connect** button below. If your browser does not support web serial, you will see a warning instead of a button.

      <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/esp-web-tools@9/dist/web/install-button.js?module"></script>
      <esp-web-install-button manifest="https://firmware.esphome.io/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo/manifest.json"></esp-web-install-button>
   - **For advanced users**: The configuration file is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo.yaml).

2. Connect the ATOM Echo to your computer.
   - In the pop-up window, view the available ports.
   - Plug the USB-C cable into the ATOM Echo and connect it to your computer.
   - In the pop-up window, there should now appear a new entry. Select this USB serial port and select **Connect**.
     - Depending on your computer, the entry might look different.
   ![Select USB port](/images/assist/esp32-atom-flash-select-port.png)
   - If no new port shows, your system may be missing a driver. Close the pop-up window.
     - In the dialog, select the CH342 driver, install it, then **Try again**.
   ![Open My link](/images/assist/esp32-atom-flash-no-port.png)
3. Select **Install Voice Assistant**, then **Install**.
     - Follow the instructions provided by the installation wizard.

       - Select **Connect**.
       - The ATOM Echo now joined your network. Select **Add to Home Assistant**.
4. This opens the **My** link to Home Assistant.
   - If you have not used My Home Assistant before, you will need to configure it. If your Home Assistant URL is not accessible on `http://homeassistant.local:8123`, replace it with the URL to your Home Assistant instance.
   - Open the link.
   ![Open My link](/images/assist/esp32-atom-flash-06.png)
5. Select **OK**. 
   
   ![Set up ESPHome](/images/assist/esp32-atom-flash-07.png)
6. If, at this stage, a dialog opens, prompting you to enter the connection settings of your ESPHome node, it means there is already a configuration set up for that ESPHome device.
   - Close the dialog and perform the procedure on [deleting the ATOM Echo configuration from ESPHome](/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/#to-delete-the-atom-echo-configuration-from-esphome).
   - Restart Home Assistant.
   - Then, under {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %}, your ATOM Echo should be discovered.
7. To add the newly discovered device, select the ATOM Echo from the list.
   - Add your ATOM Echo to a room and select **Finish**.
8. You should now see the **ESPHome** integration.
   ![New ESPHome device discovered](/images/assist/m5stack-atom-echo-discovered-33.png)
9.  Select the **ESPHome** integration. Under **Devices**, you should see the **M5Stack Atom Echo** listed.
   ![ATOM Echo discovered](/images/assist/m5stack-atom-echo-discovered-new-03.png)
   - Your ATOM Echo is connected to Home Assistant over Wi-Fi. You can now move it to any place in your home with a USB power supply.
10. Congratulations! You can now voice control Home Assistant using a button with a built-in microphone. Now give some commands.

## Controlling Home Assistant over the ATOM Echo

1. Say your wake word. For this tutorial, use "OK, Nabu".
   - Wait for the LED to start blinking in blue.
2. Say a [supported voice command](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/). For example, *Turn off the light in the kitchen*.
   - While you are speaking, the blue LED keeps pulsing.
   - Once the intent has been processed, the LED lights up in green and Home Assistant confirms the action.
      - Make sure youâ€™re using the area name exactly as you defined it in Home Assistant.
      - You can also ask a question, such as
          - *Is the front door locked?*
          - *Which lights are on in the living room?*
3. Your command is not supported? Add your own commands using [a sentence trigger](/voice_control/custom_sentences/).
4. You find ATOM Echo takes too long to start processing your command?
   - Adjust the silence detection settings. This setting defines how much silence is needed for Assist to find you're done speaking and it can start processing your command.
   - Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
   - Under **M5Stack ATOM Echo**, select **1 device**.
   ![Open My link](/images/assist/esp32-atom_silence_detection_01.png)

## Disabling wake word and use push-to-talk

1. If you do not want to use a wake word, but prefer to use the microphone by pressing a button, you can disable the wake word.
2. Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
   - Under **M5Stack ATOM Echo**, select **1 device**.
3. Disable **Use wake word**.
   
   ![Toggle to enable/disable wake word](/images/assist/wake_word_disable_on_atom_echo.png)
4. To start using push-to-talk, press the flat button with rounded shape on your ATOM Echo.
   - The rectangular button on the side is the reset button. Do not press that one.
   - As soon as you press the button, the LED will start blinking in blue. If it does not light up, press again.
   - While you are speaking, the blue LED is pulsing.
   - Once the intent has been processed, the LED lights up in green and Home Assistant confirms the action.

## Troubleshooting

Are things not working as expected?

- Checkout the [general troubleshooting section for Assist](/voice_control/troubleshooting/).
- You think there is a problem with noise or volume? Checkout the procedure below.

### Tweaking the ATOM Echo configuration

1. Make sure you have [access to your configuration files](/common-tasks/os/#configuring-access-to-files).
2. Edit the general configuration:
   - Access the `config` folder and open the `configuration.yaml` file.
   - Enter the following text:
      ```yaml
      assist_pipeline:
         debug_recording_dir: /share/assist_pipeline
      ```
3. Save the changes and restart Home Assistant.
4. Make sure you have the [Samba add-on installed](/common-tasks/os/#configuring-access-to-files).
5. On your computer, access your Home Assistant server via Samba.
   - Navigate to `/share/assist_pipeline`.
   - For each voice command you gave, you will find a subfolder with the audio file in `.wav` format.
6. Listen to the audio file of interest.
7. Adjust noise suppression and volume, if needed:
   - Access the `config` folder and open the `esphome/m5stack-atom-echo-wake-word.yaml` file.
   - Find the `voice_assistant` section.
   - If the audio is too noisy, increase the `noise_suppression_level` (max.&nbsp;4).
   - If the audio is too quiet, increase either the `auto_gain` (max.&nbsp;31) or the `volume_multiplier` (no maximum, but a too high value will cause distortion eventually).
8. Collecting the debug recordings impacts your disk space.
   - Once you have found a configuration that works, delete the folder with the audio files.
   - In the `configuration.yaml` file, delete the `assist_pipeline entry` and restart Home Assistant.
